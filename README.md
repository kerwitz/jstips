# Introducing Javascript Tips
> New year, new project. **A JS tip per day!**

With great excitement, I introduce short and useful Javascript tips per day that will allow you to improve your code writing. With less than 2 minutes each day, you will be able to read about performances, frameworks, conventions, hacks, interview questions and all the items that the future of this awesome language holds for us.

At midday, no matter if it is a weekend or a holiday, a tip will be posted and tweeted.

Just to give you a glance, this is an example of how the tips would be like.

## Insert item inside an array
> 12/29/2015

Insert an item into an existing array is a daily common task. You can add elements to the end of an array using [`Array.prototype.push()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push), to the beginning using [`Array.prototype.unshift()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/unshift), or the middle using [`Array.prototype.splice()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice).
But those known methods doesn't mean that are the more porformant, here we go...

Add a element at the end of the array is easy with [`Array.prototype.push()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push), but there are a way more performant.

```javascript
var arr = [1,2,3,4,5];

arr.push(6);
arr[arr.length] = 6; // 43% faster in Chrome 47.0.2526.106 on Mac OS X 10.11.1
```
Both methods modify the original array. Doesn't believe me? Check the [jsperf](http://jsperf.com/push-item-inside-an-array)

Now we are trying to add a item to the beginning of the array 

```javascript
var arr = [1,2,3,4,5];

arr.unshift(0);
[0].concat(arr); // 98% faster in Chrome 47.0.2526.106 on Mac OS X 10.11.1
```
Here a little bit detail, unshift edit the original array, concat return a new array. [jsperf](http://jsperf.com/unshift-item-inside-an-array)

Add items at the middle of an array is easy with splice and is the most performant way to do it.

```javascript
var items = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four'];
items.splice(2, 0, 'hello');
```
I tried run these test in various navigators and os and the results was similar, I hope you try your own test and that these tips will be useful!
